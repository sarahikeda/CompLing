John        saw     a cat
subject -> verb  --> object
John saw   [a cat that was walking around]
                noun phrase (NP)
John perceived [a black cat]
                  noun phrase
John got a glimpse of a black cat
[Some guy who I made up as an example] saw a [cat]
        NP                                    NP

NOUN PHRASE has to move together


John (saw a cat)
        VP

Complexity of an algorithm
- linear - n steps of algorithm
- square - pieces of data, n(squared) steps
- cubic  - n(to the 3) steps
- exponential 2(to the n steps)

best method is cubic unless you're doing chunking (finding noun phrases)

Evaluation:
  1) Precision - how much what you see is good and relates to your query
  2) Recall - out of all the relevant stuff out there, how much are you finding
  Precision and recall can be complimentary. Think about a search engine.
  3) F-score - combines precision and recall

Precision =  TP
           ------
            TP + FP

Recall =   TP
        --------
         TP + FN

F-score = 2 * Precision * Recall
        --------------------------
           Precision + Recall

Confusion Matrix
  1) Precision: what a system calls 'yes', true positive, false positive
  2) Recall: true positives + false negatives

Context free grammar to describe the syntax of English:
  Sentence = NP VP
  VP = V  NP | V
  NP = PN | PRON | DT N

  LEXICON
    PN -> John
    PRON -> they
    DT -> a | the
    N -> duck
    V -> sleeps | saw

  Issues:
    - Intransitive vs transitive verbs
      - Sleeps vs saw
    - pronouns need to have other cases
    - noun/verb agreement
